# To-do list

## Ideas
- Carl-Johan Dalgaard Malthus model? Dynamisk malthusmodel


## Coding-wise

## Methods to implement

## Specifics
- Model description
	* ✓ Add markdown explanations
	* ✓ Eta is expected to be large in societies where there is a particular cultural valuation of having many children and/or where cost of child rearing are modest.
	
- Law of motion for the labor force
	* ✓ Can sympy rewrite this so that L_t is not in the denominator?
	
- Algorithm notation
	* how it is written in the lecture?
	
- Possible extensions of model
	* ✓ Growing techonology (A)
	* Death rate dependant on income
	* ✓ What about long run living standards?

- Readability:
	* Some kind of separation between declaring symbols and equations and performing the actual algorithm

- Graphic and Parameterization
	* Remove "higher A" from initial graphic, it will be tested by the interactive widget
	* Interactive widget function in .py
	* Rækkefølge af args i lom_func og ss_func burde være ens, skal ændres gennem hele funktionen

- Figure 1.
	* New colors (perhaps defined with imports and set magics)
	* Function legend next to function
	* Remove grid
	* Remove axis values
	* Increase axis title size
