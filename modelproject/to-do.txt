## Specifics
- Intro notes
	* ✓ Github numbers all equations, please open the notebook in jupyter to get correct equation numbering.

- Model description
	* ✓ Add markdown explanations
	* ✓ Eta is expected to be large in societies where there is a particular cultural valuation of having many children and/or where cost of child rearing are modest.
	
- Law of motion for the labor force
	* ✓ Can sympy rewrite this so that L_t is not in the denominator?
	
- Algorithm
	* Notation: how it is written in the lecture?
	* STEP4: Can we move AX outside paranthesis, like later on?
	
- Possible extensions of model
	* ✓ Growing techonology (A)
	* ✕ Death rate dependant on income
	* ✓ What about long run living standards?
	* Kig på numerical income pr cap?
	
- Extended model
	* ✓ Implement numerical solution
	
- Declaring symbols
	* Remove assumptions not needed
	
- Conclusion
	* Something about Malthus not predicting the industrial revolution.
	* What actually needs to change in model for contious growth in income, not population.

- Readability:
	* ✓ Some kind of separation between declaring symbols and equations and performing the actual algorithm

- Graphic and Parameterization
	* ✓ Remove "higher A" from initial graphic, it will be tested by the interactive widget
	* ✓ Interactive widget function in .py
	* Rækkefølge af args i lom_func og ss_func burde være ens, skal ændres gennem hele funktionen

- Figure 1.
	* New colors (perhaps defined with imports and set magics)
	* Function legend next to function
	* ✕ Remove grid
	* ✕ Remove axis values
	* Increase axis title size
