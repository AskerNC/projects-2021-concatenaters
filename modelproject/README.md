# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **a simple dynamic Malthusian model** and is about the generally accepted model for economic growth prior to the industrial revolution and modern growth as we know from the Solow-Swan model.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
